Decision tree models include several hyperparameters that control how the tree grows and how well it generalizes. Some important ones are max_depth, which limits the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting; min_samples_split, which specifies the minimum number of samples required to split a node; and min_samples_leaf, which defines the minimum number of samples required to be present at a leaf node. Other parameters include max_features, which determines the number of features to consider when finding the best split; criterion, which specifies the function used to measure the quality of a split (like “gini” or “entropy”); and max_leaf_nodes, which restricts the number of terminal nodes in the tree. Adjusting these hyperparameters helps balance the trade-off between bias and variance, ensuring the model neither overfits nor underfits the data.
Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding are two common techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical form for machine learning models. Label Encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category, such as converting {Red, Green, Blue} to {0, 1, 2}. It is simple and efficient but can introduce an unintended ordinal relationship between categories, which might mislead certain algorithms. One-Hot Encoding, on the other hand, creates separate binary columns for each category, representing each observation as a combination of 0s and 1s (e.g., Red → [1, 0, 0], Green → [0, 1, 0], Blue → [0, 0, 1]). This approach avoids any ordinal assumptions but increases the dataset’s dimensionality, especially when dealing with features that have many unique categories. Label Encoding is best suited for ordinal data, while One-Hot Encoding is preferred for nominal (unordered) categorical data.
